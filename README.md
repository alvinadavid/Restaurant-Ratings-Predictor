# Restaurant-Ratings-Predictor
A machine learning project that predicts a restaurantâ€™s review rating category based on features such as average cost for two, table booking availability, online delivery availability, and price range. The project uses a trained ML model with a Streamlit web interface for easy user interaction.

# HOW IT WORKS?
The model is trained using past restaurant data, which includes features such as average cost, table booking availability, online delivery option, and price range, along with their actual ratings.
By learning patterns from this historical data, the model can predict the likely rating category for any new restaurant with similar details.
